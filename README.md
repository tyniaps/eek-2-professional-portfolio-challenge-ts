Introduction to Advanced CSS

## Description

The Professional Portfolio challenge was completed following deeper exploration into the topic of<br>
Cascading Style Sheets.

Building on from previously gained knowledge on HTML code and the role it plays in creating the foundations of a web-page, completing this challenge allowed for an understanding of various CSS concepts, including but not limited to CSS Selectors, The Box Model, Flex-box and Media Queries. 

Another key learning point was understanding the elements that must be utilised in order to ensure that HTML and CSS communicate with eachother when loading a web-page.
